<h4>My Bio</h4>

<p>
My favorite thing to do on my free time is play on the computer with my cousins and sister. I have 3 sisters and no brothers. 
When I grow up I want to be a nurse. I also have 1 pet and it is a dog. My favorite color is blue. 
My favorite animal is a cheetah because they are fast.
