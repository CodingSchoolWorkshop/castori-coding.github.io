<h4>Things About Me</h4>  

<p>
I like to do a lot of things with my family.I have 3 sisters and no brothers. Our family also got a dog and he is really cute. We got the 
dog 2 months ago and still needs training. He got used to the house and my little sister loves to play with him. He doesn't really go on 
trips with us. My whole family loves him a lot and we think that he is really entertaining to us. The day we got him was really cool because
he got to ride in the car with us the whole way home. Anyways, I have a lot of cousins and they are all really fun to play with. I have a
cousin who is the same age as me. She is mostly the cousin I like to play with a lot.
