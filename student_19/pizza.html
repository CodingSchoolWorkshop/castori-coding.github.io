  <h2> About me </h2>
  <p>My name is Emily and I am 10 years old. I have 2 sisters. In my spare time I enjoy reading A Series of Unfortunate Events.
    Some of my favorite foods are tamales, pizza, and candy. My favorite color is turquoise and mint green. My favorite animal 
    is a bunny. I dont own one but I love them.
