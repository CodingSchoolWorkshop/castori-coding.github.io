Hello! This is my first website. Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm in Girl Scouts and I am a Cadette. I also love the color blue. My favorite animal is a llama! I am a very weirdly unique person.

<h1>I love llamas!</h1>
<p> For my free time I like to play Super Mario Bros, watch videos on Youtube, play Bakery Story or Hay Day, and sometimes I read.</p>
