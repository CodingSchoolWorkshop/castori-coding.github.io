    <h2>Hello! My name is Ashley and I'm a HUGE fan of Greek Mythology!
     I remember in 4th grade that I enjoyed researching about the gods and goddesses, therefore I made a website based on them!
     I hope you enjoy and learn something or alot from this website.
    Since you absolutely know nothing about me I am going to share some fun facts about me.
    I am a girl (Duh look at my name)! I am a girl scout and I am in my Cadette year.
    My favorite goddess is Aprodite, and my favorite god is Hades (I like villains).
    I am bilingual! The languages I speak are Spanish and English (I'm Latino American).
    My favorite color is Blue and Green (mostly Blue). I LOVE to read fantasy/adventure books!
    I play Animal Jam! My name's Berrycool30 and I LOVE Five nights at Freddy's!
    Now enough abot me (tear)! I know this is an abrupt start but here is what you need to know about gods and goddesses.
     
     
   <p>First God:
     Zeus!
    Zeus (as you may know is the boss!) Hahaha. 
    He is the god of gods so really he is the boss. His wife is Hera (goddess of women and marriage). 
    Hera is one of Zeus's three sisters. Enough about Hera though it is Zeus's spotlight!
