 <h1> Hello Disney Villains fans! My name is Ashley and I'm a big fan of Disney (especially the villains).
  This website is about the villains, their backstories, their personalities, and their dislikes/likes.
  Since you don't know me that well I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself!
  I'm a girl (hence my name)! My favorite color is blue and my favorite animal is a llama. My favorite pokemon type is water and fire!

   Enough about me (tear)! Let me talk some more haha! About villains!
  First one up! Jafar!
